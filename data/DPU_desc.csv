 With the growing population of Filipino students at DePauw University, it is important to recognize and celebrate their unique Philippine heritage. With so many culturally-established clubs, there is no student organization that acknowledges the presence of Filipino students at DePauw University. It is very hard for the specified students to express and share their culture to other communities as well as to internalize the essence of being an international student at DePauw University. FSA, therefore, aims to celebrate Filipino traditions and customs at DePauw University and help Filipino students succeed in their university-level learning without losing their cultural identity.

 In 1868, the Indiana Zeta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta was established at DePauw University. 
 Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven&rsquo;t budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded by &ldquo;The Immortal Six&rdquo;. The pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, they refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude. 
 Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person&rsquo;s true self, and by learning from each other&rsquo;s strengths while helping to improve each other&rsquo;s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own.

 The fundamental purpose of the Sigma Chi International Fraternity is the cultivation, maintenance and accomplishment of the ideals of friendship, justice and learning within its membership. 
 The Fraternity best serves that purpose by developing, implementing and monitoring programs that foster leadership, build character and promote positive relationship skills, which in turn enable its members to become productive and caring participants in their families, colleges and communities.

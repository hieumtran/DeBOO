The game uses data collected from various organizations affiliated with DePauw's Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI), such as VSA, House of Opulence, and Students of Color in STEM. DeBOO, the Boss Of Organizations, prefers cross-cultural activities involving people from diverse background (e.g. genders, religions, and majors).
